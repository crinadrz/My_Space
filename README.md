# My_Space
In order to digest all the concepts I've encountered, I thought about making a project, it should be like this:

ðŸŒŸI'll call it "My Space". When (if) someone will (ever) access the site, they'll first see a rocket that's preparing to launch.

ðŸŒŸThe user would have to press on that rocket ( I hope it's possible xD ) and the rocket would start to "fly" and I hope I can create some stars.

ðŸŒŸ After this, the user would see some info about the site and if they're interested they could register/ sign in.

ðŸŒŸAfter signing in they could see stuff like how's the weather for that day, something like journaling maybe (I'll think about more sections) .. I want it to be "healing" .. maybe suggest some chill music ( or any genre according to their mood).. This part is work in progress
